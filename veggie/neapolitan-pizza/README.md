## Ingredients

* 500 grams (4 cups) of flour
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 7 grams of dry yeast
* 325 mil (1.37 cups) warm water
* Fresh basil
* Fresh mozzarella

## Directions

* Mix yeast in warm water and stir slowly; then mixture to flour salt
* Knead flour mixture for 10 minutes
* Stretch dough and top with tomatoes and mozzarella
* Bake in oven for 5 to 7 minutes at highest temperature; rotate pizza a few times to get heat evenly distributed
* Add basil after pizza is ready

Having a pizza steel plate or pizza stone will help with the heat retention.  

Some people cook pizza dough with basil.  The method is also known as basil cremation -- we don't recommend it
