# recipes

This repository is a loose collection `Culinary Nerdom`.  It's not intended to replace any magical recipe book out there.  It's simply a collection of recipes and notes.  The cooking philosophy is simple:

* Fast and easy to make
* Use pre-mixed spices whenever possible
* Make no assumptions on the skill level of the cook

Bon Appetit!
