# recipes

This repository is a loose collection `Culinary Nerdom`.  It's not intended to replace any magical recipe book out there.  It's simply a collection of my recipes and notes.  The cooking philosophy is simple, fast and easy to make.  I use pre-mixed spices whenever possible and there is no assumption on the skill level of the cook.

Bon Appetit!
